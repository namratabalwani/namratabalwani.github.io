This compelled me to choose Computer Science and Engineering as my major at <a href=\"https://www.vit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune</a> (2014-2018) to understand the\r\nunderlying technologies and frameworks that machines are built on.</p>\n<p>During my senior year, I interned at <a href=\"https://wisdmlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wisdmlabs</a>, a company that builds creative and effective web\r\nsolutions with WordPress. While working here, I picked up essential web development\r\nskills and developed mobile-friendly and responsive websites for our clients.</p>\n<p>After completing my undergraduate education, I joined a multinational corporation\r\n<a href=\"https://www.emerson.com/global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Emerson Electric Co</a> as an Associate Software Engineer. At Emerson, I stepped up my game further\r\nand developed its MES product (‚ÄòManufacturing Execution System‚Äô) for various marquee\r\npharmaceutical customers like Moderna, Lonza, BMS, DSM, and Novartis using the .NET framework.</p>\n<p>Identifying a major gap in our core practice of developing WiX installers for Emerson‚Äôs proprietary software, I\r\ndeveloped an internal tool to automate the process. This brought down the installer development time\r\nto ~2 hours, saving up to 25 hours each for 50 software products, and I was awarded the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDaE8Fw5uqfsXnpBCLpeFINwTCWouGzX/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SPOT award</a>\r\nfor my initiative.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!</p>"}}]},"jobs":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Graduate Teaching Assistant","company":"Stony Brook University","range":"Jan 2023 -
