I'm a software developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently I'm a grad student in computer engineering at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), where I'm diving deep into the exciting world of distributed systems, operating systems, and the intriguing realm of data structures and algorithms.

When I'm not immersing myself in the digital universe, you can catch me grooving on the dance floor or smashing birdies on the badminton court!💃🏸💻🌟
