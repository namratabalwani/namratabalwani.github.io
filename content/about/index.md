Hello! Currently I'm a grad student in computer engineering at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), where I'm diving deep into the exciting world of distributed systems, operating systems, and the intriguing realm of data structures and algorithms with a GPA of 3.72 on scale of 4.

Interestingly, I first got introduced to C programming in 9th grade in school and I realized right away that Computer Science was 
my calling. This compelled me to choose Computer Science and Engineering as my major at [Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune](https://www.vit.edu/) (2014-2018) to understand the 
underlying technologies and frameworks that machines are built on. 

During my senior year, I interned at [Wisdmlabs](https://wisdmlabs.com/), a company that builds creative and effective web 
solutions with WordPress. While working here, I picked up essential web development 
skills and developed mobile-friendly and responsive websites for our clients. 

After completing my undergraduate education, I joined a multinational corporation 
[Emerson Electric Co](https://www.emerson.com/global) as an Associate Software Engineer. At Emerson, I stepped up my game further 
and developed its MES product (‘Manufacturing Execution System’) for various marquee 
pharmaceutical customers like Moderna, Lonza, BMS, DSM, and Novartis using the .NET framework. 

Identifying a major gap in our core practice of developing WiX installers for Emerson’s proprietary software, I 
developed an internal tool to automate the process. This brought down the installer development time 
to ~2 hours, saving up to 25 hours each for 50 software products, and I was awarded the [SPOT award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDaE8Fw5uqfsXnpBCLpeFINwTCWouGzX/view?usp=sharing) 
for my initiative.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
